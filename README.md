## 📏 Rules

- Objective: The objective of the game is to paint as much of the map as possible with your color while avoiding other players.

- Controls: Use the arrow keys to move in the desired direction.

- Starting the game: At the beginning of the game, you will be placed on a blank map. Choose a skin and start painting the map.

- Avoid other players: Avoid other players who try to block or eliminate you. If you another player (or yourself) collide with your trail, you lose and must start over.

- Gain points: You gain points by painting the map. You can also steal other players' points when you eliminate them!
